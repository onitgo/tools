                                    <h3>Analyze call detail records (CDRs)</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">Telcos perform forensics on dropped calls and poor sound quality,
                                        but call detail records flow in at a rate of millions per second. This high
                                        volume makes pattern recognition and root cause analysis difficult, and often
                                        those need to happen in real-time, with a customer waiting for answers. Delay
                                        causes attrition and harms servicing margins. Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF™) can
                                        ingest millions of CDRs per second into Hortonworks Data Platform, where Apache™
                                        Storm or Apache Spark™ can process them in real-time to identify troubling
                                        patterns. HDP facilitates long-term data retention for root cause analysis, even
                                        years after the first issue. This CDR analysis can be used to continuously
                                        improve call quality, customer satisfaction and servicing margins.</p>
                                    <h3>Customer Churn Analysis</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">Accurate diagnosis of customer churn and enabling of alerts when a
                                        customer exhibits behavior that suggests imminent defection is a critical
                                        requirement for telcos. By looking at multiple factors, such as comments on
                                        social media and declining usage, along with historical data that show patterns
                                        of behavior that suggest churn, companies can predict when a customer is at risk
                                        of defecting. The MapR Converged Data Platform helps bring together customer
                                        transaction data and communication streams from customers in real-time that can
                                        show how customers feel about their service. This is critical for detecting and
                                        addressing customer satisfaction issues in real time.</p>
                                    <h3>Fraud Detection</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">CSPs need to protect their customers and their bottom line by
                                        proactively detecting fraudulent activities. They can analyze usage data,
                                        location-specific data and customer account data in real time to model baseline
                                        “normal” behavior. The MapR Converged Data Platform can enable building of
                                        predictive models that can flag anomalous phone calls that might indicate theft
                                        or hacking, both in business-to-business and business-to-consumer environment.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">CSPs can make more accurate and relevant recommendations to
                                        customers in real time by analyzing customer call logs, usage and customer
                                        satisfaction data combined with social media data to understand customer
                                        preferences and behavior. These recommendations can include cross-selling new
                                        services, matching pricing plans, or making targeted offers for sports or music
                                        enthusiasts. The MapR Converged Data Platform delivers real-time capabilities
                                        that enable recommendations to be delivered at just the right time and place.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Network Management/Optimization</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">Bandwidth demand is growing 60% per year, leaving operators
                                        increasingly unable to respond to spikes. With an Cloudera enterprise data hub,
                                        gain a real-time view to allocate network resources more efficiently, build
                                        predictive capacity models, and adopt a next-best-investment approach.</p>

                                        leaders had long relied on Lean manufacturing to grow volumes and reduce costs,
                                        but it became increasingly difficult to discover incremental ways to enhance
                                        yields. They looked into Open Enterprise Hadoop for new insights that could
                                        further reduce costs and improve yields. Merck turned to Hortonworks for data
                                        discovery into records on 255 batches of one vaccine going back 10 years. That
                                        data had been distributed across 16 maintenance and building management systems
                                        and it included precise sensor data on calibrations settings, air pressure,
                                        temperature, and humidity. After pooling all the data into Hortonworks Data
                                        Platform and processing 15 billion calculations, Merck had new answers to
                                        questions it had been asking for a decade. Among hundreds of variables, the
                                        Merck team was able to spot those that optimized yields. The company proceeded
                                        to apply those lessons to their other vaccines, with a focus on providing
                                        quality drugs at the lowest possible price. Watch Doug Henschen’s

                                    <p class="fs-5">One Hortonworks pharmaceutical customer uses HDP for a single view
                                        of its supply chain and their self-declared “War on Waste”. The operations team
                                        added up the ingredients going into making their drugs, and compared that with
                                        the physical product they shipped. They found a big gap between the two and
                                        launched their War on Waste, using HDP big data analytics to identify where
                                        those valuable resources were going. Once it identifies those root causes of
                                        waste, real-time alerts in HDP notify the team when they are at risk of
                                        exceeding pre-determined thresholds.</p>
                                    <h3>Translational Research: Turning Scientific Studies Into Personalized Medicine
                                    </h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">The goal of Translational Research is to apply the results of
                                        laboratory research towards improving human health. Hadoop empowers researchers,
                                        clinicians, and analysts to unlock insights from translational data to drive
                                        evidence-based medicine programs. The data sources for translational research
                                        are complex and typically locked in data siloes, making it difficult for
                                        scientists to obtain an integrated, holistic view of their data. Other
                                        challenges revolve around data latency (the delay in getting data loaded into
                                        traditional data stores), handling unstructured and semi-structured types of
                                        data, and bridging lack of collaborative analysis between translation and
                                        clinical development groups. Researchers are turning to Open Enterprise Hadoop
                                        as a cost-effective, reliable platform for managing big data in clinical trials
                                        and performing advanced analytics on integrated translational data. HDP allows
                                        translational and clinical groups to combine key data from sources such as:
                                        Omics (genomics, proteomics, transcription profiling, etc) Preclinical data
                                        Electronic lab notebooks Clinical data warehouses Tissue imaging data Medical
                                        devices and sensors File sources (such as Excel and SAS) Medical literature
                                        Through Hadoop, analysts can build a holistic view that helps them understand
                                        biological response and molecular mechanisms for compounds or drugs. They’re
                                        also able to uncover biomarkers for use in R&D and clinical trials. Finally,
                                        they can be assured that all data will be stored forever, in its native format,
                                        for analysis with multiple future applications.</p>
                                    <h3>Next Generation Sequencing</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">IT systems cannot economically store and process next generation
                                        sequencing (NGS) data. For example, primary sequencing results are in large
                                        image format and are too costly to store over the long term. Point solutions
                                        have lacked the flexibility to keep up with changing analytical methodologies,
                                        and are often expensive to customize and maintain. Open Enterprise Hadoop
                                        overcomes those challenges by helping data scientists and researchers unlock
                                        insights from NGS data while preserving the raw results on a reliable,
                                        cost-effective platform. NGS scientists are discovering the benefits of
                                        large-scale processing and analysis delivered by HDP components such as Apache
                                        Spark. Pharmaceutical researchers are using Hadoop to easily ingest diverse data
                                        types from external sources of genetic data, such as TCGA , GENBank , and EMBL.
                                        Another clear advantage of HDP for NGS is that researchers have access to
                                        cutting-edge bioinformatics tools built specifically for Hadoop. These enable
                                        analysis of various NGS data formats, sorting of reads, and merging of results.
                                        This takes NGS to the next level through: Batch processing of large NGS data

                                    <h3>Assure Just-In-Time Delivery of Raw Materials</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">Manufacturers want to minimize the inventory that they keep on hand
                                        and prefer just-in-time delivery of raw materials. On the other hand, stock-outs
                                        can cause harmful production delays. Sensors, and RFID tags and IoT in
                                        manufacturing reduce the cost of capturing supply chain data, but this creates a
                                        large, ongoing flow of data. Hadoop can store this unstructured data at a
                                        relatively low cost. That means that manufacturers have more visibility into the
                                        history of their supply chains and they are able to see large patterns that
                                        might be invisible in only a few months of data. This intelligence can give
                                        manufacturers greater lead-time to adjust to supply chain disruptions. It also
                                        allows them the connected factory to reduce supply chain costs and improve

                                    <h3>Control Quality with Real-Time & Historical Assembly Line Data</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">High-tech manufacturers use sensors to capture data at critical
                                        steps in the manufacturing process. This data is useful at the time of
                                        manufacture, to detect problems while they are occurring. However, some subtle
                                        problems—the “unknown unknowns”—may not be detected at time of manufacture.
                                        Nevertheless, those may lead to higher rates of malfunction after the product is
                                        purchased. When a product is returned with problems, the manufacturer can do
                                        forensic tests on the product and combine the forensic data with the original
                                        sensor data from when the product was manufactured. This big data in
                                        manufacturing adds added visibility, across a large number of products, helps
                                        the manufacturer improve the process and products to levels not possible in a

                                    <p class="fs-5">Today’s manufacturing workflows involve sophisticated machines
                                        coordinated across pre-defined, precise steps. One machine malfunction can stop
                                        the production line. Premature maintenance has a cost; there is an optimal
                                        schedule for maintenance and repairs: not too early, not too late. Machine
                                        learning algorithms can compare maintenance events and machine data for each
                                        piece of equipment to its history of malfunctions. These algorithms can derive
                                        optimal maintenance schedules, based on real-time information and historical
                                        data. This The use of manufacturing predictive analytics can help maximize
                                        equipment utilization, minimize P&E expense, and avoid surprise work stoppages.

                                        inefficiencies in the costs, risks involved. Here they use our solutions for
                                        quicker analysis, metrics to do different types actionable data insights on
                                        structured and unstructured data, probably real time.

                                        With the services we are providing, patient records are analyzed and anomalies
                                        such as frauds in billing will be detected. While patient privacy is being
                                        guaranteed, healthcare providers gain a 360-degree view of the patient by
                                        storing, processing, and correlating.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5">Of course, the latest technologies have made huge difference in
                                        healthcare and hospitals have already adopted. With these advanced measurements,
                                        Patients are monitored in live and the data that is streamed will be captured
                                        into cluster so that whenever a patient gets any problem, hospital staff will be
                                        alerted automatically. Using this stream data, healthcare predictive analytics
                                        can be done apart and Machine learning algorithms will be written to predict the

                                        regularly. But it may not be same when they are discharged as many ppl ignore
                                        the prescription of the doctor. This ignorance is the main cause for the High/

                                    <h3>Machine Learning for Autism</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5">According to health statistics, Autism is one of major challenges to
                                        be faced by the world now-a-days. It affects 1 in 100 children at an annual cost
                                        estimated at more than $100 billion. Told by experts, it takes eighteen months
                                        to detect autism in a person, who has been affected. Sadly, more than 1 in 4
                                        cases are still undiagnosed at 8 years of age. Many people don’t know that the
                                        most common diagnostic test typically takes 2 hours to administer and score.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class="fs-5">Dr. Dennis Wall is Director of the Computational Biology Initiative
                                        at the Harvard Medical School. In this presentation, he describes a process his
                                        team developed for low-cost, mobile screening for autism. It takes less than
                                        five minutes and relies on the ability to store large volumes of semi-structured
                                        data from brief in-home tests administered and submitted by parents. Wall’s lab
                                        also used Facebook to capture user-reported information on autism.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class="fs-5">Artificial intelligence running on those huge data sets helps
                                        maximize efficiency of diagnosis without loss of accuracy. This approach, in
                                        combination with data storage on a Hadoop cluster, can be used for other
                                        innovative machine learning diagnostic processes.</p>
